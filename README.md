# Ok that does sound pretty cool. What is the team’s vibe saying?

Based in Soho the development team work from the brands headquarters and one of their flagship clubs. Pretty sick right? There are currently about 15 people in technology with Ruby being the primary development skill however they also use JavaScript, Vue.JS, Node.JS and have plans to expand into native mobile development. The vibe is very friendly-orientated, and there will always be a helping hand if you have any questions or get stuck. You will be nurtured and guided to be the best developer you can be. Plus, you’ll be working with some pretty cool individuals on an interesting technical project in the centre of Soho…I mean that does sound like the dream if you ask me. 


# Very dreamy indeed! What type of projects could I be working on?
•	Create reusable JavaScript components and libraries for use across the business.
•	The chance to get involved in building mobile native mobile applications (Swift and Android).
•	Creation of a social network for business for use by their members.


# Yes yes YES I’m so down! Do I need a particular set of skills? 

As I said before, you need to be a devoted lover of Vanilla JavaScript. The team currently use Vue.js but they will be open to developers who have experience with either of the frameworks e.g. React, Angular. You should have the ability to work autonomously and be depended on to get the job done. You will need to have an interest in understanding the business domain with a view to basing technical decisions on improving the experience of the customer.
